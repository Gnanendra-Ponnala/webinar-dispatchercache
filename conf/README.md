Configurations
-----

* *httpd.conf* is a simplified Apache httpd server configuration for Redhat 5.  It can be adapted with slight modifications work in almost any Linux Apache 2.x installation. *WARNING* it is meant for learning only so it has been condensed to only the directives necessary to make dispatcher work.  *DO NOT* use this httpd.conf in a production environment as it may be insecure to do so.
  * To use it you will need to configure the DocumentRoot, mime.types file path and other options to match your environment.
* *dispatcher.any* is a sample dispatcher.any configuration which just demonstrates some of the features mentioned in the presentation.
